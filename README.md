# Reconaacharya Challenge Defcon 31: Rules of the game!
1. **Challenge Submission**: You would have received an email instructions on your registered email to submit the valid submissions. Use your unique AWS S3 signed URL to upload your submissions.
2. **File Submission Rules:**
    * **Filename:** The file containing your subdomains should be named `subdomains.txt`. 
    * **New Line Separation:** When entering subdomains in the submission file, each one should be placed on a new line.
    * **DNS Resolution:** All subdomains you list must be resolvable from Google's public DNS server (8.8.8.8).
    * **Valid Records:** Each subdomain must have a valid DNS record. This can be an 'A' record, a 'TXT' record, or a 'CNAME' record or 'MX' record.
    * **Off-Target Subdomains:** If you include subdomains that are not within the target domains, they will be treated as invalid and potentially face penalties.
    * **Wildcard Subdomains:** Subdomains that use wildcards (e.g., `*.example.com`) are not permitted.
    * **File Size Limit:** The size of your `subdomains.txt` file should not exceed 25MB.

6. **Mandatory Writeup:** Along with your list of subdomains, a writeup explaining your findings and methodologies is mandatory.
7. **Transparency:** All the listed subdomains will be made public once the challenge is over.
8. **Invalid Subdomains Penalty:** If your list contains an excessive number of invalid subdomains (beyond a set limit), you will be banned from the challenge.
10. **No Attacking:** Do not launch any attacks on the listed domains or subdomains. This challenge is purely for discovery and enumeration, not exploitation.
11. **Subdomains submission:** You are allowed to upload only 100 valid files. Any files uploaded beyond this number will not be considered.


**Violation of any of the above rules can lead to disqualification from the Reconaacharya challenge. Ensure to follow the rules diligently.**
